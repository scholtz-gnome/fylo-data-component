# Frontend Mentor - Fylo data storage component solution

This is a solution to the [Fylo data storage component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/fylo-data-storage-component-1dZPRbV5n). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

### Getting set up

The solution is found in a single html file, found [here](index.html). The CSS is found under `public/styles/` and the required images are located in `public/assets/images/`.

The html is served with a simple Node.js/Express server. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. To install the required dependencies, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm ci
```

In order to serve the `index.html` file, you'll need to run the server with the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
